## 📊 New Game Mechanics

### Scoring System

| Scenario | Points |
|----------|--------|
| **Correct - Regular Child** | 1 point per candy |
| **Correct - Special Child 👑** | 2 points per candy |
| **Incorrect Allocation** | 0.5 points |
| **No Allocation** | 0 points |

### Example Scoring

**Round 1:**
- Child 1 (regular) wants: 2🍭 + 1🍫
  - Correct allocation = **3 points** (3 candies × 1)
- Child 2 (special 👑) wants: 3🐻 + 1🍭
  - Correct allocation = **8 points** (4 candies × 2)
- Child 3 (regular) wants: 2🍫 + 2🐻
  - Correct allocation = **4 points** (4 candies × 1)

**Maximum Round Score:** 15 points

## 🎮 Game Flow

### Old (v1.0):
1. Random round generation
2. Divide candies equally among all children
3. 10 points if correct, 0 if wrong
4. Simple validation

### New (v2.0):
1. Load rounds from `game-config.json`
2. Each child has specific requests
3. Player allocates to each child individually
4. Multiple scoring levels (0, 0.5, 1, or 2 points per candy)
5. Inventory validation
6. Per-child feedback
